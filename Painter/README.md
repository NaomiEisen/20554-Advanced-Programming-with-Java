# ðŸŽ¨ Painter Application

The Painter application is a JavaFX-based drawing program that allows users to interactively create and manipulate basic geometric shapes such as lines, rectangles, and ellipses on a canvas. Users can select different colors, decide whether shapes should be filled or outlined, and choose the type of shape they want to draw.
