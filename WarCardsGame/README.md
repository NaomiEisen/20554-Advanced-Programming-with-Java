## Features
- Interactive Gameplay: Players engage in a card battle against the computer, drawing cards from their respective decks and comparing their values to determine the winner of each round.
- Graphical User Interface: Utilizes JOptionPane to provide interactive dialogues that inform the player of game progress, wins, losses, and ties.
- Dynamic Deck Management: The game handles two decks of cards, managing shuffles, splits, and card transfers between decks during gameplay.
- War Mechanics: Implements the "war" scenario when players draw cards of equal value, leading to additional draws and increased stakes.
Endgame Scenarios: Provides specific dialogs for winning, losing, or tying the game, enhancing the game experience with thematic graphics and messages.

## How It Works
Classes and Their Roles
- **Main:** Launches the game by creating an instance of Game.
- **DeckOfCards:** Manages the deck operations, including shuffling, splitting the deck between the player and the computer, and updating game statuses based on the deck's state.
- **Card:** Represents individual playing cards, each associated with a face, suit, and computed value based on the card's rank.
- **Graphics:** Handles all user interactions through dialog messages using various icons to represent game states and actions.
- **Status Classes:**  Represent different game conditions and outcomes for the player and computer, including round results and overall game status.
  
## Game Flow
1. Initialization: At startup, the deck is created, shuffled, and split evenly between the player and the computer.
2. Gameplay Loop:
- Players alternately draw cards from the top of their decks.
- The game compares the values of the drawn cards to determine the round winner.
- Cards are transferred to the winner's deck, or additional cards are drawn in the event of a "war".
3. Checking Game Status: After each round, the game checks if either player has won by accumulating all cards or lost by depleting their deck.
  
## Graphical Interface
- Dialogs: Interactive dialogs guide the player through the game, providing options to continue or exit after each round and displaying messages corresponding to different game events like wins, losses, and ties.
  
## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Swing library (included with JDK)
